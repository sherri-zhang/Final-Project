# How Do Think Tanks Write  About SNAP Benefits?

This research project examines how four think tanks, two left-leaning and two right-leaning, write about SNAP benefits, a politicized and controversial social welfare program. The study analyzes publications from August 2021 from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Heritage Foundation, Brookings, and Urban Institute to observe any differences in sentiment and word importance. The project aims to determine if think tanks have taken a neutral stance, or if their policy recommendations have influenced their wording and sentiment towards SNAP. Using various text analysis methods, this report found that right-leaning think tanks tend to use stigmatized language and focus on work requirements and taxpayer costs, while left-leaning think tanks focus on expansion and portray SNAP beneficiaries as sympathetic. The report also notes that AEI, a right-leaning think tank, had the most publications and the lowest lexical density, suggesting a different approach to publications. However, sentiment analysis proved to be better suited for shorter texts and did not yield meaningful results.
